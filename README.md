# Stroke Prediction

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.

## Project
In this project, we'll be exploring a dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) containing the information on strokes. This dataset will be used to predict whether a patient is likely to get a stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age and healthy habits.
